# interpretable-gnn
This is a code repo to host codes on 2020 Summer IBM-MIT-RPI collaboration on interpretable graph neural network, and its visualization. 

`gradient_A_coco_get_data.py`

get .json file of the graph data of clustering result, and .scv file of the gradient map.

`change_A_coco_.py`

the same as gradient_A_coco_get_data.py, but not get the data file. Calculate the gradient map of adjacency matrix, and visualize the clustering result.
