# interpretable-gnn
This is a code repo to host codes on 2020 Summer IBM-MIT-RPI collaboration on interpretable graph neural network, and its visualization. 
gradient_A_coco_get_data.py is the same as change_A_coco.py, but if you need to get the graph data of clustering result, you need to run gradient_A_coco_get_data.py.
